# pacman
HTML5 Pacman

Introduction:
----

This is a slightly modified version of Dale Harvey's Pacman code.

I have made some slight modifications to that original code to achieve a singular result: make it easy to play the first few levels and make it super tough to play later levels. Also, the ghosts are less intimidating in the first few levels.

My changes also give you:
* a lot of score very quickly
* a lot of lives very quickly (although you start with just 1 life - but the game is so easy during that life that you will soon accumulate tons of lives for the future)

Unfortunately, within a short while after staering the game, it gets kinda hard. You will see when you play the game. So, how do you play the game?

Just download the zip of this code repo onto your computer. Unzip the zip file you have downloaded in the previous step. That should create a directory/folder called "pacman-master". Get into that dir/folder and double click the "index.html" file. That should start the game in a new tab in your default browser.

A few things to note:
----

I am NOT a JS programmer. So, I have used my little knowledge from other programming languages to make the changes.

I am NOT a github user. So, if this doesn't work, don't blame me. Be nice and let me know by raising an issue.

Hope you enjoy my changes to DH's Pacman code. :D
